Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind. - Bernard M. Baruch

DINING ROOM - DAY

Two friends are sitting around a table arguing. A third is sitting in a chair nearby

            JAMIE
    What I'm saying is that reality shows offer us a chance to live vicariously through other, more interesting people.

            KELLY
        (hands in the air)
    Oh come on - interesting, really? How interesting could some rednecks trying to pawn their old crap be? Or guys making duck calls for a living?

            JAMIE
    What about telling the stories of those down-on-your luck families, getting their
home renovated or fixed after a dishonest contractor took all their money and left?

            KELLY
    And how do you suppose they pay for the taxes on the new houses? Plenty of them have been reclaimed.

            JAMIE
    Yeah, I suppose, but -

            KELLY
    And most of them aren't even about that, anyway. They're over dramatized contests, or celebrities who are famous for doing nothing in particular.

            JAMIE
    So they're entertainment, is that so bad? It's no better or worse than sports!

            KELLY
    Don't get me started on sports!

Kelly pauses to think.

            KELLY (CONT'D)
    Anyway, take Survivor. People competing to survive in a place people already live! And it's not like they're in danger of dying in any case.

                CUT TO:

INTERVIEW CHAIR

            KELLY
        (amused)
    It's ridiculous, how much stock (s)he puts in to that crap! It's not like any of these are great drama, like a Shakespeare. Half the time any tension is created by crappy close ups of super concerned people before a commerical break.

                CUT TO:

INTERVIEW CHAIR

            JAMIE
    I don't get why Kelly gets so upset about this stuff.
    It's not like it's life or death really, it's TV! It doesn't have to be high art.

                CUT TO:

DINING ROOM

            JAMIE
    Yeah, they wouldn't die, but it does put normal people in a challenging position that most of the industrialized world doesn't have to experience.

            KELLY
    Those aren't real people - they're acting! They know they're being filmed, they've seen the show. People auditioning for that know what the producers want, and do their best to fit a role. The liar, the nice guy, the bad girl.

                CUT TO:

LiVING ROOM

Mark is sitting in a chair nearby, reading. He can hear the conversation but doesn't appear to be paying attention.

            JAMIE
    Look, I'm not saying they're not totally real, but some still give exposure to people with talents.
    Take American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance. They give people a chance to show of their skills in front of a wide audience.

            KELLY
    Sure, sure - tell me, how many of the winners can you list, right off the bat?

Jamie counts on fingers.

            JAMIE
    Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, James Taylor, Ruben, Chris Daughtry....

            KELLY
        (laughing)
    See, you don't even know.  And James Taylor *definitely* wasn't on the show.

            JAMIE
    Look, it doesn't matter. You're getting way too worked up about what people do in their free time.

            KELLY
        (sarcastic)
    Yeah, right it totally doesn't matter that we're building a nation of idiots.

            JAMIE
    Hey, don't get shitty with me. You brought it up.

                CUT TO:

LIVING ROOM

Mark glances over his book, shakes his head, and goes back to reading.

                CUT TO:

DINING ROOM

            KELLY
    Ok, ok - yeah, I guess. What about the text voting crap?
        (in an announcer voice)
    Text P E N I S to 5555 to vote for the ditzy blonde!

            KELLY (CONT'D)
        (normal voice)
    Whatever happened to just calling?

            JAMIE
    Nobody calls people anymore, come on.

            KELLY
    You just called the vet to ask about your dog's plastic surgery

            JAMIE
    That's different! Princess's snout job was necessary, she felt insecure at the dog park.

Mark and Kelly both laugh.

            JAMIE
    Hey, it's not funny! She needs to rebuild her self esteem!

            KELLY
    Right, right. This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. I love my pets, too, but come on.

            JAMIE
    They did it on Real Housewives of..

            KELLY
        (cutting Jamie off)
    See, see!

            JAMIE
    Shut up!

            KELLY
        (laughing)
    Look, ok, if that makes you and Princess happy, fine. Whatever.
    But do you really think that those people are good to emulate?

Jamie stands up and paces, arms crossed.

            JAMIE
    Now you're making it personal!

            KELLY
    Sorry, you just gave me a really good example. You're emulating this manufactured image. Those people on TV giving their dog nose jobs -

            JAMIE
    Snout!

            KELLY
    - jobs don't have real work to do.

Several close up shots showing Jamie and Kelly looking angry, and one showing Mark reading. Dramatic music is playing.

                FADE TO:

EXT. CAR LOT

            ANNOUNCER (V. O.)
    Do you need a car? A bike? Christmas dinner? Come on down to Ed's Eclectic Emporium!

        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
    We've got all kinds of stuff. Eatin' stuff, ridin' stuff, drivin' stuff. You want shit, we got shit.

                FADE TO:

INT. INTERVIEW CHAIR

Jaime is sitting in the interview chair, obviously upset.

            JAMIE
    Kelly is accusing me of copying reality shows with my dog, but it was totally my idea. I'm not copying anyone.

            KELLY
    Jamie thinks I said her dog's snout job was ridiculous.

Kelly pauses to think.

            KELLY (CONT'D)
    It really is, but she's totally missing the point.

                CUT TO:

KITCHEN TABLE

Both Kelly and Jamie are sitting down again. Mark is still reading.

            KELLY
    Jamie, I'm sorry for insulting you and Princess. I'm just trying to show what a bad idea it is to glorify unresponsible, childish behavior.

            KELLY
        (shouting)
    Childish?

Mark closes his book, and stands up. He walks over to the table

            JAMIE
        (yelling too)
    It's not my fault you wasted money on your dog's 'self esteem'

 Mark drops the book on the table to interrupt them both.

            MARK
    Really, both of you? This is worth yelling about?

            KELLY
    Well

            JAMIE
    But

            MARK
    Up to you guys, but I'm going to go on a walk, maybe get some ice cream.

Mark walks out the door and closes it. Kelly and Jamie look at each other, confused.

            JAMIE
    But it's February

                FADE TO BLACK.

                FADE IN:

INTERVIEW CHAIR

Mark walks in and sits in the interview chair.
He pauses for a second before talking.

            MARK
    I think the snout job brings out her eyes.


                FADE TO BLACK.
