Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Two friends are sitting around a table arguing. A third is sitting in a chair nearby

JAMIE
What I'm saying is that reality shows offer us a chance to live vicariously through other, more interesting people.

KELLY
(hands in the air)
Oh come on - interesting, really? How interesting could some rednecks trying to pawn their old shit?

JAMIE
What about telling the stories of those down-on-your luck families, getting their
home renovated or fixed after a dishonest contractor took all their money and left?

KELLY
And how do you suppose they pay for the taxes on the new houses? Plenty of them have been reclaimed.

JAMIE
Yeah, I suppose, but -

KELLY
And most of them aren't even about that, anyway. They're over dramatized contests, or celebrities who
are famous for doing nothing in particular.

JAMIE
So they're entertainment, is that so bad? It's no better or worse than sports!

KELLY
Don't get me started on sports! So take Survivor. People competing to survive in a place people already live!
And it's not like they're in danger of dying in any case.

CUT TO:

INT. INTERVIEW CHAIR

KELLY
(obviously angry)
It's ridiculous, how much stock (s)he puts in to that crap! It's not like any of these are life or death
things, and half the time any 'drama' is created by crappy close ups of super concerned people.

CUT TO:

INT. INTERVIEW CHAIR

JAMIE
I don't get why Kelly gets so upset about this stuff.
It's not like it's life or death really, it's TV! It doesn't have to be high art.

CUT TO:

INT. DINING ROOM

JAMIE
Yeah, they wouldn't die, but it does put normal people in a challenging position that most of the industrialized world
doesn't have to put up with.

KELLY
Those aren't real people - they're acting! They know they're being filmed, they've seen the show.
People auditioning for that know what the producers are looking for.

CUT TO:

INT. LiVING ROOM

Mark is sitting in a chair nearby, reading. He can hear the conversation but doesn't appear to be paying attention.

JAMIE
Look, I'm not saying they're not really contrived, but they still give exposure to people with talents.
Take American Idol or So You Think You Can Dance. They give people a chance to show of their skills in front of a wide audience.

KELLY
Sure, sure - tell me, how many of the winners can you list, right off the bat?

JAMIE
(counting on fingers)
Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, James Taylor, Ruben, Chris Daughtry....

KELLY
(laughing)
See, you don't even know.  And James Taylor *definitely* wasn't on the show.

JAMIE
Look, it doesn't matter. You're getting way too worked up about what people do in their free time.

KELLY
(sarcastic)
Yeah, right it totally doesn't matter that we're building a nation of idiots.

JAMIE
Hey, don't get shitty with me. You brought it up.

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM

Mark glances over his book, shakes his head, and goes back to reading.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN

KELLY
Ok, ok - yeah, I guess. What about the text voting crap?
(in an announcer voice)
Text P E N I S to 5555 to vote for the ditzy blonde!

KELLY (CONT'D)
(normal voice)
Whatever happened to just calling?

JAMIE
Nobody calls anymore, come on.

KELLY
You just called the vet to ask about your dog's plastic surgery

JAMIE
That's different! Princess's snout job was necessary, she felt insecure at the dog park.

Mark and Kelly both laugh.

JAMIE
Hey, it's not funny! She needs to rebuild her self esteem!

KELLY
Right, right. This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. I love my pets, too, but come on.

JAMIE
They did it on Real Housewives of..

KELLY
(cutting JAMIE off)
See, see!

JAMIE
Shut up!

KELLY
(laughing)
Look, ok, if that makes you and Princess happy, fine. Whatever.
But do you really think that those people are good to emulate?

Jamie stands up and paces, arms crossed.

JAMIE
Now you're making it personal!

KELLY
Sorry, you just presented a good example. You're emulating this manufactured image. Those people on TV giving their dog nose jobs -

JAMIE
Snout!

KELLY
- jobs don't have real work to do.

Several close up shots showing Jamie and Kelly looking angry, and one showing Mark reading.

FADE TO:

EXT. CAR LOT

ANNOUNCER (V. O.)
Do you need a car? A bike? Christmas dinner? Come on down to Sheldon's Shit Shop.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
We've got all kinds of shit. Eatin' shit, ridin' shit, drivin' shit. You want shit, we got shit.

FADE TO:

INT. INTERVIEW CHAIR

Jaime is sitting in the interview chair, obviously upset.

JAMIE
Kelly is accusing me of copying reality shows with my dog, but it was totally my idea. I'm not copying anyone.

KELLY
Jamie thinks I said her dog's snout job was ridiculous.

Kelly pauses to think.

KELLY (CONT'D)
It really is, but she's totally missing the point.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN TABLE

Both Kelly and Jamie are sitting down again. Mark is still reading.

JAMIE
Jamie, I'm sorry for insulting you and Princess. I'm just trying to show what a bad idea it is to glorify unresponsible, childish behavior.

KELLY
(shouting)
Childish?

JAMIE
(yelling too)
It's not my fault you wasted money on your dog's self esteem...

Mark closes his book, and stands up. Mark walks over and drops the book on the table to interrupt them both.

MARK
Really, both of you? This is worth yelling about?

KELLY
Well

JAMIE
But

MARK
Up to you guys, but I'm going to go on a walk.

Mark walks out the door and closes it. Kelly and Jamie look at each other, confused.

FADE TO BLACK.
