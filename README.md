The main contents of this repository is the `script.fountain` file, which contains [fountain.io](http://fountain.io) markup to produce screenplay output for PDF.

I used the [TextPlay](http://olivertaylor.net/textplay/) utility to convert the file to PDF for previewing during writing, mostly to get a page count.
